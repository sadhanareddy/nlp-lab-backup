Hidden Markov Model can be used for finding out POS tags from the transmission and emission matrix. It is observed that POS tags can be improved, if context is also considered and therefore, HMM seems helpful for this task. When we have emission and transmision matrix, various algorithms can be applied to find out the POS tags for words. Some of possible algorithms are: Backward algorithm, forward algorithm and viterbi algorithm. Here, in this experiment, you can get fmiliar with Viterbi Decoding<br/>
