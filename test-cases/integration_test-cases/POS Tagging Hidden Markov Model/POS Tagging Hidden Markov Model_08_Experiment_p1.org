* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the POS Tagging: Hidden Markov Model experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/natural-language-processing-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/POS Tagging Hidden Markov Model/POS Tagging Hidden Markov Model_01_Usability_smk.org][POS Tagging Hidden Markov Model_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any junk characters and distortions present in the Experiment page
  3. Select the type of Corpus from the dropdown list displayed on the screen 
  4. Fill up the bigram probabilities in the Emission Matrix table and Transition Matrix tables that is generated
  5. Click on 'submit' button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we select the type of corpus from the dropdown list displayed on the screen  a table should be generated at the bottom of the page with the selected corpus features
  4. The given options should be validated with the backend database and the result should be displayed on the screen
  5. When we click on the 'get answers' button, all the correct answers should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the 'hide answers' button all the answers should get hidden and only the result should be displayed on the screen
